# Clei-Convert

This is a simple tool to convert date format in a CSV file. 
It was created to help me with a specific task, but I believe it can be useful for others.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
```bash  
git clone   
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application
```bash 
python clei-convert.py
```

## How to convert in .exe file
Follow the steps below:

```bash 
pyinstaller --onefile --upx-dir C:\upx .\clei-convert.py
```
UPX helps to reduce the size of the executable file. You can download it [here](https://upx.github.io/)
